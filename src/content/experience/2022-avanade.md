Solution Architect for the Modern Application Transformation team.

Solutioning at Avanade starts in pre-sales; involves solution planning, contracting, and carries right through to delivery.

So far I've solutioned:

- a discovery workshop for a large insurer
- a cloud integration transformation for a retailer
- a discovery workshop for a critical NHS service
- an application to allow sharing of priority services register data between suppliers
- a rough-order-of-magnitude for a high-street retailer's app modernization program
