Solution Architect for the Modern Application Transformation team.

Solutioning at Avanade starts in pre-sales; involves solution planning, contracting, and carries right through to delivery. Some highlights include the following.

### Support for All

Solutioned and delivered an [OfWat Water Innovation Challenge winning project](https://waterinnovation.challenges.org/winners/support-for-all/) to design and build a hub for securely storing and sharing priority register data between utilities so that vulnerable customers will automatically receive help even where their details are missing or out of date.

### An NHS Organisation

With a number of deals and deliveries, I have worked with this organization for two years to help identify issues within their current delivery process, run workshops to create solutions and deliver a DevOps Excellence roadmap for the future.

### UK Insurer

Working as the delivery lead for an off-shore team to provide resource for this insurer for their IFRS-17 analytics transformation.

### Examination Board

Presales and solution for a company looking to add media portal capabilities to their existing cloud platform.

### Oil & Gas Technology Company

Presales and solution for a company that wanted to move a custom Python data solution previously running from an employee's desktop to a production solution in Azure cloud. This was primarily an architecture review with subsequent recommendations for a final solution.

### Managed Services for Financial Service Company

Client wanted to transition their microservice solution to a managed support model within Avanade. I provided technical expertise and advice during presales to ensure that all the relevant tools and technologies were included within the deal. Hosting a series of workshops to transfer knowledge from the client teams to Avanade I was able to build up a complete solution description with minimal available documentation.
