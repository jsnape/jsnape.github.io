I've been blogging on and off for 20 years now. Originally I hosted my own version of [dasBlog](https://github.com/shanselman/dasblog); in fact its Tricoleur theme was created by me. For simplicity I moved to a managed blog at http://wordpress.com but always found the support for code highlighting lacking.

When I had some time over Christmas, I decided to rebuild this blog using standard web technologies so I could own both the code and content published. This is the result.
