Responsible for delivering business intelligence services to the fixed income sales, e-commerce and e-trading within BNP Paribas.

This is a dual role consisting of solution architecture and team management. As architect I meet regularly with the business to discuss and address their concerns with business intelligence solutions created by my team. I spend time selling the product, educating the business and negotiating architectural trade-offs. Even though a certain amount of pragmatism is required in the fast paced nature of investment banking I keep the product vision on track and moving towards my target architecture.

As team manager I look after a team of 8-10 developers and 1-2 business analysts. We work in 2 week scrum sprints delivering value back to the business regularly. The team is new to agile methodologies so I am in a directing and coaching phase until they have the capability to self-organize. Recently we are also looking at taking on some lean concepts such as Kanban and limited work in progress. I am particularly interested in lean architecture.

I also have line manager responsibilities such as personnel development, annual reviews and objective setting.
