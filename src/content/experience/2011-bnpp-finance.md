When I first arrived at the bank whilst working for Microsoft there was little or no FX business intelligence capability and much of the business was run from departmental Excel spread sheets.

### January 2012: Fixed Income Business Intelligence (Solution Architect)

On the back of the successful FX data warehouse delivery below the project is expanded to cover the whole of fixed income (FX, interest rate and credit products). The team size increased to match and the architect/manager role is split into two. I preferred to concentrate on architecture.

This is a complex project due to the large number of data sources and a requirement to conform dimensions across business lines where there has been no cross product data governance.

Given the length of the project, this role has covered:

- Traditional up front solution architecture during project initiation and early iterations
- Agile just-in-time architecture as requirements move up the backlog, keeping technical debt under control
- More recently to look at 1-2 year and future increments to the existing architecture in order to adapt the product to changing business needs

I also mentor developers and leads with design and code reviews, pair programming sessions, process advice and knowledge sharing sessions on techniques and technologies.

More recently we have expanded the scope of the project to include a big data/Hadoop cluster and some master data functionality. I am currently working on three sub-projects within the scope of business intelligence:

- Data quality – this is more of an enterprise architect role as it involved proof of concepts, tool selection and roll out to the entire business.
- Time to market – I’m doing a lean analysis of our current development process in order to reduce waste and deliver features faster.
- Solution consolidation – given recent reorganisations it has become necessary to consolidate business intelligence solutions from other parts of the business.

I provide consulting to other project teams on Reporting Services, Analysis Services, Tableau and business intelligence solution delivery.

### January 2011: eCommerce Business Intelligence (Solution Architect and Development Manager)

This is a dual role consisting of solution architecture and team management. As architect I meet regularly with the business to discuss and address their concerns with business intelligence solutions created by my team. I spend time selling the product, educating the business and negotiating architectural trade-offs. Even though a certain amount of pragmatism is required in the fast paced nature of investment banking I keep the product vision on track and moving towards the target architecture.

As team manager I look after a team of 8-10 developers and 1-2 business analysts. We work in 2 week scrum sprints delivering value back to the business regularly.

I also have line manager responsibilities such as staff development, annual reviews and goal setting.
