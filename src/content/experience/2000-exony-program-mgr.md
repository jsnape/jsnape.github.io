Software architecture and project management for Exony's reporting and analytics platform.

_Exony was bought by eGain in 2014._

### March 2006: Development Manager

I oversaw most of the projects at Exony from an architectural and management perspective whilst also acting as the project manager for our Business Intelligence reporting product. This is a web-based product used in all the major UK telcos for both enterprise and hosted call centre BI. I also maintained my SQL, DTS and C# skills by developing some of the features.

Some of the projects I completed at Exony include:

- Architected, implemented and deployed the sit-up.tv auction system
- Designed and implemented a SQL/OLAP installer tool to cut Exony’s upgrade and patching costs
- Gathering requirements from France Telecom
- Architect and project management for the latest release of Exony’s reporting platform, recently installed for a US government department’s call centre
- Writing MS Reporting Services rendering and delivery extensions

### April 2001: Exony Gateway (Architect)

The Gateway is Exony’s integration product. It consists of an XML processing pipeline in the core with a multitude of equipment specific connectors allowing us to connect most telecoms equipment such as ICM and voice response units to back-end customer systems. The product performs a similar role to Microsoft’s BizTalk, but within the real-time constraints imposed by telecoms. It is usually deployed in a hosted mode so there are internal application firewalls to make sure processing from one customer can not affect the other customers running in the same application instance.

My role on the project was to create the initial architecture and implementation.

### May 2000: INsight Call Centre Management (Project Leader)

INsight is a web-based call centre system that allows agents to view charts and statistics on various operational aspects. The project is a typical n-tier application distributed across a number of servers. The main communications schemes used in the system are: HTTP, XML, COM and OLEDB.

Again, I was the main product architect.
