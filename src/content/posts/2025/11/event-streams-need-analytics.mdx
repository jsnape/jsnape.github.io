## Introduction

Event-driven architectures are everywhere—IoT telemetry, application logs, clickstreams, financial transactions. The common pattern? High-volume, high-velocity data streams flowing into your cloud environment.

Most teams instinctively think:

> We need to store this data. Let’s use Cosmos DB.

But here’s the problem: storage alone doesn’t deliver value. If you can’t analyze your events quickly, you’re flying blind. And bolting analytics onto a transactional database like Cosmos DB is a recipe for latency, complexity, and cost overruns.

## The Analytics Gap

- Cosmos DB excels at storage and transactional queries, but struggles with:
    - Large-scale aggregations.
    - Time-series analysis.
    - Sub-second response times for dashboards.
- Adding analytics on top of Cosmos often means:
    - Exporting data to another system (extra cost and complexity).
    - Waiting minutes for queries that should take milliseconds.

## Why ADX Changes the Game

Azure Data Explorer (ADX) was designed for real-time analytics on event streams:

- Native ingestion from Event Hub and IoT Hub.
- Columnar storage and indexing for speed.
- Kusto Query Language (KQL) for powerful aggregations and anomaly detection.

Instead of storing events and then struggling to analyze them, ADX lets you:

- Ingest millions of events per second.
- Run queries instantly.
- Build dashboards that update in real time.

## Architecture Snapshot

Here’s what a modern event analytics pipeline should look like:

```
Event Hub → Azure Data Explorer → Power BI / Grafana
```

- Event Hub: Handles ingestion from devices or apps.
- ADX: Stores, indexes, and makes data query-ready.
- Power BI / Grafana: Visualizes insights for decision-making.

## Hands-On Example

Want to see how easy it is?

- Create an ADX cluster in the Azure Portal.
- Connect Event Hub for streaming ingestion.
- Run a simple KQL query:

```kql
Events  
| summarize count() by bin(Timestamp, 1m)  
```

This gives you a real-time event count per minute—something that would be painful and expensive in Cosmos DB.

## Key Takeaways

- Storing events ≠ extracting insights.
- Cosmos DB is great for OLTP, not OLAP.
- ADX is purpose-built for low-latency analytics on event streams.
- If you care about real-time decisions, ADX should be your default destination.
