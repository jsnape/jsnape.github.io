  It can be confusing knowing how to represent something in Azure DevOps. Should it be a work item? What about a task or new work item state? Here is my guide for you to classify with confidence.

## Introduction

I see a lot of different interpretations on how to classify content in Azure DevOps. What makes something a work item? What is the difference between a state and a board column? I mean why am I even discussing states and columns in the same post as tasks and work items? Let's dive in and look at each individually. 

## Work Item

The primary use for a work item is to capture something of value that needs to be delivered. If you were to describe the item to your customer and they respond with disinterest in you working on it then maybe you should consider one of the other three. I choose the work item level depending on the type of value:

- **Epic:** it is a waste to just call these 'large stories'. Instead consider them as _goals_ or _capabilities_ you want to deliver.
- **Feature:** a complete chunk of value your end customer will understand. Imagine writing a user guide, these are the sections that users will search for.
- **<abbr title="Product Backlog Item">PBI</abbr>:** might not all be user stories but most are and since stories are [small and negotiable](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/invest/) they tend to be considered a bullet point on a feature for end users. This is especially true once you have split stories to fit in sprints.

## Work Item State

I don't think folks pay much attention to states and generally treat them as a set of steps that work goes though until its done. This gives rise to my pet hate - the _testing_ state, the idea that you don't do any testing until the work has cleared development.
