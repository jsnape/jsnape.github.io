This is the second part in a series of data warehouse presentations Iâ€™ve been giving. This one concentrates on the physical design of the underlying SQL Server database, some information on the [SQL Server Fast Track Data Warehouse](http://www.microsoft.com/sqlserver/2008/en/us/fasttrack.aspx) and finally a one slide guide to tuning the storage engine performance. The tuning slide is only really a first step and I plan a more in depth session some time in the future.

Also I apologize, this deck is a little word heavy. I prefer more graphics in a presentation but there is a lot of specific guidance to list here.
