My [programmer personality](http://www.doolwind.com/index.php?page=11) type is: **DHTC**

**You're a** **D****oer.** You are very quick at getting tasks done. You believe the outcome is the most important part of a task and the faster you can reach that outcome the better. After all, time is money.

**You like coding at a** **H****igh level.** The world is made up of objects and components, you should create your programs in the same way.

**You work best in a** **T****eam.** A good group is better than the sum of its parts. The only thing better than a genius programmer is a cohesive group of genius programmers.

**You are a** **C****onservative programmer.** The less code you write, the less chance of it containing a bug. You write short and to the point code that gets the job done efficiently.
