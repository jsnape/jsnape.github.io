Its been nearly 10 years since I last posted an article on this site.
Having children and other priorities pushed blogging lower down the priority stack.
Plus the site used hosted on https://jamessnape.wordpress.com/ and getting embedded code to
look good was an effort.

My kids are older now and I'm interested in using this site to learn about new technologies;
specifically [Astro](https://astro.build), [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

Once of the challenges I've had creating this new implementation is there are now a lot of privacy laws in place such as GDPR.
Since I use Google Analytics I have to include a [Privacy Policy](/privacy/) and cookie consent pop-up [^1].

As a guide I followed [Creating a Cookie Consent Banner for Google Tag Manager](https://webreaper.dev/posts/google-tag-manager-cookie-consent/)
to add mine here. This example uses Solid JS for the implementation of the 
consent functionality and its not familiar to me so I turned to Bing Copilot for help.

First step is to ask a general question "_how to convert solidjs to svelte?_"

> To convert SolidJS to Svelte, you can follow the steps below:
> 
> 1. First, install the latest version of Svelte by running the following command in your terminal:
> `npm install svelte@latest`
> 
> 2. Next, create a new Svelte component file with the same name as your SolidJS component file.
> For example, if your SolidJS component file is named `MyComponent.js`, create a new file named `MyComponent.svelte`.
> 
> 3. Copy the contents of your SolidJS component file into your new Svelte component file.
> 
> 4. Replace any SolidJS-specific syntax with equivalent Svelte syntax.
> You can refer to the official Svelte documentation for more information on Svelte syntax.
> 
> 5. Finally, compile your Svelte component file into a JavaScript file that creates the DOM and CSS files that style it.
> You can use SvelteKit, the official application framework from the Svelte team, to handle this process.
> Run the following command in your terminal:
> `npm run dev`
> 
> I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

This is a nice high level plan but the 4th point is a little light on detail so next question "_expand on point 4 please_".

> Sure, I can explain more about point 4. Point 4 is about replacing any SolidJS-specific syntax with equivalent Svelte syntax.
> This means that you need to change the way you write your component logic, state, props, events, and other features 
> that are different between SolidJS and Svelte.
>
> Here are some examples of how to convert some common SolidJS syntax to Svelte syntax:
> - **Component logic**: In SolidJS, you write your component logic inside a function that returns JSX.
> In Svelte, you write your component logic inside a `<script>` tag that can export variables and functions to the template. For example:
> ```typescript
> // SolidJS
> import { createSignal } from "solid-js";
> 
> function Counter() {
>   const [count, setCount] = createSignal(0);
> 
>   function increment() {
>       setCount(count() + 1);
>   }
> 
>   return (
>     <div>
>       <p>Count: {count()}</p>
>       <button onClick={increment}>+1</button>
>     </div>
>   );
> }
> ```
> ### HTML
> ```html
> <!-- Svelte -->
> <script>
>   let count = 0;
> 
>   function increment() {
>     count++;
>   }
> </script>
> 
> <div>
>   <p>Count: {count}</p>
>   <button on:click={increment}>+1</button>
> </div>
> ```
> - **State**: In SolidJS, you use `createSignal` to create reactive state variables that are updated
> by calling setter functions. In Svelte, you use `let` to declare reactive state variables that 
> are updated by assigning new values. For example:
> ```typescript
> // SolidJS
> import { createSignal } from "solid-js";
> 
> function App() {
>   const [name, setName] = createSignal("World");
> 
>   function handleChange(e) {
>     setName(e.target.value);
>   }
> 
>   return (
>     <div>
>       <h1>Hello {name()}!</h1>
>       <input type="text" value={name()} onInput={handleChange} />
>     </div>
>   );
> }
> ```
> ### HTML
> ```html
> <!-- Svelte -->
> <script>
>   let name = "World";
> 
>   function handleChange(e) {
>     name = e.target.value;
>   }
> </script>
> 
> <div>
>   <h1>Hello {name}!</h1>
>   <input type="text" bind:value={name} on:input={handleChange} />
> </div>
> ```
> - **Props**: In SolidJS, you use props to access the properties passed to your component 
> from the parent component. In Svelte, you use export to declare the properties that your
> component expects from the parent component. For example:
> ```typescript
> // SolidJS
> function Greeting(props) {
>   return <p>Hello, {props.name}!</p>;
> }
> ```
> ### HTML
> ```html
> <!-- Svelte -->
> <script>
>   export let name;
> </script>
> 
> <p>Hello, {name}!</p>
> ```
> - **Events**: In SolidJS, you use `onClick`, `onInput`, `onChange`, and other event handlers
> to listen to user interactions on your elements. In Svelte, you use `on:click`, `on:input`,
> `on:change`, and other event listeners to listen to user interactions on your elements. For example:
> ```typescript
> // SolidJS
> function Button(props) {
>   return <button onClick={props.onClick}>{props.label}</button>;

> ```
> ### HTML

There is quite a lot of specific information in this response to I started to convert the code
but didn't understand the following:

```typescript
createEffect(() => {
    setIsMounted(true);
    // get cookie approval after component is mounted
    setCookies(getCookieConsent());
  });
```

...so another question: "_Convert the following solidjs code to svelte: `plus the code above`_".
The response is both accurate and uncannily expands the example to include the complete code.

> To convert the following SolidJS code to Svelte, you can use the `onMount` lifecycle function
> from Svelte, which runs after the component is first rendered to the DOM. For example:
> ```typescript
> // SolidJS
> import { createEffect } from "solid-js";
> 
> function App() {
>   const [isMounted, setIsMounted] = createSignal(false);
>   const [cookies, setCookies] = createSignal(null);
> 
>   createEffect(() => {
>     setIsMounted(true);
>     // get cookie approval after component is mounted
>     setCookies(getCookieConsent());
>   });
> 
>   return (
>     <div>
>       <p>Is mounted: {isMounted() ? "Yes" : "No"}</p>
>       <p>Cookies: {cookies()}</p>
>     </div>
>   );
> }
> ```

> </script>

> <div>
>   <p>Is mounted: {isMounted ? "Yes" : "No"}</p>

This got me to the stage where I could convert the typescript part of of the code.
Only the markup to go but some of it isn't plain HTML, specifically the `<Show>` element.
So I asked "_What is the equivalent svelte construct to a solidjs `<Show>` element?_".

The final response was all I needed.

> The equivalent Svelte construct to a SolidJS `<Show>` element is the `{#if ...}` block.
> The `<Show>` element in SolidJS is used to conditionally render a component based on a boolean expression.
> The `{#if ...}` block in Svelte does the same thing, but with a different syntax.
> For example:
> ```typescript
> // SolidJS
> import { Show } from "solid-js/web";
> 
> function App() {
>   const [show, setShow] = createSignal(true);
> 
>   function toggle() {
>     setShow(!show());
>   }
> 
>   return (
>     <div>
>       <button onClick={toggle}>Toggle</button>
>       <Show when={show()}>
>         <p>This is shown when show is true</p>
>       </Show>
>     </div>
>   );
> }
> ```
> ### HTML
> ```html
> <!-- Svelte -->
> <script>
>   let show = true;
> 
>   function toggle() {
>     show = !show;
>   }
> </script>
> 
> <div>
>   <button on:click={toggle}>Toggle</button>
>   {#if show}
>     <p>This is shown when show is true</p>
>   {/if}
> </div>

You can ask to convert the code in one go but I like being able to learn along the way.
Asking GPT to break a problem down usually results in a better response.

## Final code

The final code for the converted CookieConsent.svelte component looks like:

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
    declare function consentGranted(): void;
    declare function getCookieConsent(): string;

    import { onMount } from "svelte";

    let cookies = "unk";
    let isMounted = false;
    export let CookieConsent;

    const handleAccept = () => {
        cookies = "granted";

        // accepted cookie lasts for a year
        let d = new Date();
        let oneYear = new Date(d.getFullYear() + 1, d.getMonth(), d.getDate());

        document.cookie = "cookie-consent=granted; expires=" + oneYear + "; path=/";
        
        consentGranted();
    };

    const handleDecline = () => {
        cookies = "denied";
    
        // declined cookie only lasts for the session
        document.cookie = "cookie-consent=denied; path=/";
    };

  // this waits to load the cookie banner until the component is mounted
  // so that there is not a component flash
  onMount(() => {
        isMounted = true;
        // get cookie approval after component is mounted
        cookies = getCookieConsent();
    });

</script>

<!-- if there is no cookie for "cookie-consent", display the banner -->
{#if isMounted}
    <div
    id="cookie-banner"
    class={`${
        cookies === "granted" || cookies === "denied" ? "hidden" : ""
    } fixed bottom-0 right-0 z-50 m-2 max-w-screen-sm rounded-lg border-2 border-slate-300 bg-purple-50 text-slate-800 shadow-xl`}
    >
    <div class="p-4 text-center">
