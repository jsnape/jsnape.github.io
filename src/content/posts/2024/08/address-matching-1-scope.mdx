This is a multi-part blog series where I take the single problem of address matching from start to finish.

- Part 1 (this one): an introduction to the challenge and creation of initial acceptance criteria.
- Part 2: finding postcodes.
- Part 3: loading and filtering the AddressBase data set.
- Part 4: Splitting the incoming address into fields.
- Part 5: Working out which field is which with closest match.
- Part 6: Parsing building number from street name.
- Part 7: Matching the full address.
- Part 8: Recap and some ideas for alternate matching methods.

## Introduction

Normally I don't talk about work because its confidential but this part of a project I have on the horizon is abstract enough to talk about here.

The project is a much larger, more interesting gig which may be publicly available eventually but for now the part I can discuss is the need to match an address. Consider lots of websites allow users to input addresses in a fairly freeform style by typing into a large text area. Often there are separate fields for postcode etc but I want to try the worst case as a single string.

The second requirement is I'm not looking to parse an address, only match it with a known good record. These records are publicly available and free for a number of specific use cases (of which this project will be). The dataset I'm going to use is [AddressBase Core from Ordinance Survey](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/products/addressbase-core). I, as a person, don't meet the requirements for free access so I'll use the example download instead to write the code.

Writing a global address matcher would be very complex so it is fortunate the scope is just England and Wales in this case. Initially I'm going to ignore Wales too since I know how to make that work once I have a basic matcher up and running.

<Aside type="note" title="Welsh Addresses">
The issue with Welsh addresses is there are generally two versions, the original Welsh and an English translation. You have to check twice.
For example:
- 5 Heol y Dderwen, Caerdydd, CF24 5AB (15 Oak Road, Cardiff, CF24 5AB)
- Y Fferm Wen, Llandeilo, SA20 0AB (The White Farm, Llandeilo, SA20 0AB)
- Flat 2, 7 Bryn y Mor, Aberystwyth, SY23 1DG (Flat 2, 7 Hill by the Sea, Aberystwyth, SY23 1DG)
- Ty Newydd, Pontardawe, SA8 4LP (New House, Pontardawe, SA8 4LP)
</Aside>

## Requirements

Ultimately what I want to do is write a function that takes any old garbage in the rough form of a English address and returns the corresponding UPRN (Unique Property Reference Number) assigned by Ordinance Survey.

Let's start with some things I think I know:

1. Every address has a postcode.
2. Addresses are either comma or newline separated.

Looking at my example dataset I can see that every line has a postcode. This is something to check with the full dataset of 33 million addresses but for now it rings true. This is good because if you can match a postcode then the number of candidate matches drops significantly.

The second observation is really the difference between single line or multi-line text entry and a possible combination of both. The building number and street are not comma separated so we will have to address that separately (no pun intended). Similarly I wonder how often folks just smash the town and postcode together without a comma or newline in between?

So at this point I've got a little task list that looks like:

- Function signature `let AddressMatch = string -> string option`[^1] since UPRNs are strings too.
- Split an address by newline or comma.
- Split building number from street address.
- Handle case where no separator between town and postcode.

## Test Data

We will come back to this but I need to look at test data first. The example dataset from Ordinance Survey has approximately 51,000 records in it but for my use case I can filter it because I know every address must belong to a residential address with someone living there so no PO Boxes and no businesses. There is a `CLASSIFICATION_CODE` field and if it starts with R then its a residential address. We can remove around 5,000 records with this filter.

From the remaining data lets pick some test cases to use in my acceptance criteria.

| Test Case | Result | Reason |
| - | - | - |
|2A NEWTOWN CLOSE, EXETER, EX1 2EU|10013045896|Basic address|
|2A NEWTOWN CLOSE<br/>EXETER<br/>EX1 2EU|10013045896|Basic address but multiline|
|2A NEWTOWN CLOSE<br/>EXETER EX1 2EU|10013045896|Basic address but multiline with postcode on same line as town|
|FLAT 6, GERBERA HOUSE, MEDLEY COURT, EXETER, EX4 2QF|10013045868|Includes sub-building and building name|
|FLAT 11, BARTS MEWS, 53 BARTHOLOMEW STREET WEST, EXETER, EX4 3AJ|10013036113|All fields including building number without comma|
|ORCHARD HOUSE, IDE LANE, ALPHINGTON, EXETER, EX2 8UT|10013040942|Locality but no building number|
|19, PEGASUS COURT, NORTH STREET, HEAVITREE, EXETER, EX1 2RP|10013041164|Sub-building number and no building number|
|FLAT 2B, ANGEL PAVEMENT, 145-147 FORE STREET, ST DAVIDS, EXETER, EX4 3AN|10013042138|Complex, all fields address|
|D M A ENGINEERING, 1, GERALD DINNIS UNITS, COFTON ROAD, MARSH BARTON TRADING ESTATE, EXETER, EX2 8QW|10013042292|Red herring - D M A ENGINEERING is an organization name|

This will do to start. We can add more later but for now we can write some code. First a stub matcher that implements the correct signature above:

```csharp
public class Matcher
{
    public static string? MatchAddress(string address)
    {
        return null;
    }
}
```

Plus the set of acceptance tests:

```csharp
public class MatchSpecs
{
    [Theory]
    [ClassData(typeof(BasicAddressExamples))]
    public void BasicAddressMatching(string address, string _, string expectedUprn)
    {
        var actualUprn = Matcher.MatchAddress(address);

        Assert.Equal(expectedUprn, actualUprn);
    }
}

public class BasicAddressExamples : TheoryData<string, string, string>
{
    public BasicAddressExamples()
    {
        foreach (var (address, postcode, uprn) in GetBasicAddressExamples())
        {
            Add(address, postcode, uprn);
        }
    }

    private static IEnumerable<(string, string, string)> GetBasicAddressExamples()
    {
        yield return (
            "2A NEWTOWN CLOSE, EXETER, EX1 2EU",
            "EX1 2EU",
            "10013045896"
        );
        yield return (
            "2A NEWTOWN CLOSE\nEXETER\nEX1 2EU",
            "EX1 2EU",
            "10013045896"
        );
        yield return (
            "2A NEWTOWN CLOSE\nEXETER EX12EU",
            "EX1 2EU",
            "10013045896"
        );
        yield return (
            "FLAT 6, GERBERA HOUSE, MEDLEY COURT, EXETER, EX4 2QF",
            "EX4 2QF",
            "10013045868"
        );
        yield return (
            "FLAT 11, BARTS MEWS, 53 BARTHOLOMEW STREET WEST, EXETER, EX4 3AJ",
            "EX4 3AJ",
            "10013036113"
        );
        yield return (
            "ORCHARD HOUSE, IDE LANE, ALPHINGTON, EXETER, EX2 8UT",
            "EX2 8UT",
            "10013040942"
        );
        yield return (
            "19, PEGASUS COURT, NORTH STREET, HEAVITREE, EXETER, EX1 2RP",
            "EX1 2RP",
            "10013041164"
        );
        yield return (
            @"FLAT 2B, ANGEL PAVEMENT, 145-147 FORE STREET,
            ST DAVIDS, EXETER, EX4 3AN",
            "EX4 3AN",
            "10013042138"
        );
        yield return (
            @"D M A ENGINEERING, 1, GERALD DINNIS UNITS,
            COFTON ROAD, MARSH BARTON TRADING ESTATE
            EXETER, EX2 8QW",
            "EX2 8QW",
            "10013042292"
        );
    }
}
```

Note, I've added some multiline strings too for alternate formatting tests and included the correct postcode so I can use the same data in the next article.

Running these tests gives a failure for each one which is to be expected. When they are all green we can think about additional edge cases.

In the next post I'll look at splitting these addresses into something we can match against.
