This is a multi-part blog series where I take the single problem of address matching from start to finish.

- [Part 1](https://snape.me/2024/08/address-matching-1-scope): an introduction to the challenge and creation of initial acceptance criteria.
- [Part 2](https://snape.me/2024/08/address-matching-2-postcodes): finding postcodes.
- [Part 3](https://snape.me/2024/08/address-matching-3-filter): loading and filtering the AddressBase data set.
- [Part 4](https://snape.me/2024/08/address-matching-4-field-splitting): Splitting the incoming address into fields.
- Part 5 (this one): Working out which field is which with closest match.
- Part 6: Parsing building number from street name.
- Part 7: Matching the full address.
- Part 8: Recap and some ideas for alternate matching methods.

Manual address entry typically has typos and errors, additional characters, accented characters etc. These could be coded as specific exceptions but I would rather just say that the match 'is close enough'. To that end the most appropriate algorithm is [Levenshtein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) - a string metric for the difference between two strings. Ordering the input field by Levenshtein distance will give you the best match as the first value. Including a tolerance cutoff ensures completely dissimilar strings do not match.

To work out the Levenshtein distance I'm going to rely on a a third party library https://github.com/DanHarltey/Fastenshtein which claims to be one of the fastest implementations available. Sounds perfect given I want to do a lot of matching in bulk.

There are two APIs - one to setup and match multiple strings against a single value and another to supply both every call. I'm opting for the latter as my inputs are different each time.

```csharp
    // Calculate the distance between the two values.
    internal static int MatchDistance(string value, string match)
    {
        // Fix: if the match is longer than the value
        // then we are looking for a suffix
        var part = match[Math.Max(0, match.Length - value.Length)..];
        return Levenshtein.Distance(value, part);
    }
```

This function is going to be called in a LINQ query allowing us to match and story based on the best match. Given any set of addresses, candidates might have multiple values, for example different flats in a building, we need to match the remaining input address fields against the set of available candidates. This is the equivalent to a cross join in SQL.

```csharp
        var matches = candidateValues
            .SelectMany(c => state.UnmatchedParts
                .Select(p => (c, p, d: MatchDistance(c, p))))
            .OrderBy(m => m.d);

        var (candidate, part, distance) = matches
            // Fix: simple tolerance fails with short strings,
            // changed to percentage of length
            .Where(m => m.d * 100 / m.c.Length <= maxTolerance)
            .OrderBy(m => m.d)
            .FirstOrDefault();
```

<Aside type="note" title="LINQ Query Syntax">
I *think* the equivalent LINQ query syntax for the cross join above is:

```csharp
var matches = 
    from c in candidateValues
    from p in state.UnmatchedParts
    let m = (c, p, d: MatchDistance(c, p))
    orderby m.d
    select m;
```

I hardly ever use it though as I find it difficult to write and debug.
</Aside>

If we have a a single unmatched part and a number of candidates (sub-building in this example):

- FLAT 9
- FLAT 8
- FLAT 7
- FLAT 6
- FLAT 5
- FLAT 4
- FLAT 3
- FLAT 2
- FLAT 11
- FLAT 10
- FLAT 1

Then the match tuples are:

- (FLAT 11, FLAT 11, 0) // Zero is the best match
- (FLAT 10, FLAT 11, 1)
- (FLAT 1, FLAT 11, 2)
- (FLAT 6, FLAT 11, 3)
- (FLAT 4, FLAT 11, 3)
- (FLAT 7, FLAT 11, 3)
- (FLAT 5, FLAT 11, 3)
- (FLAT 9, FLAT 11, 3)
- (FLAT 8, FLAT 11, 3)
- (FLAT 2, FLAT 11, 3)
- (FLAT 3, FLAT 11, 3)

The best match is exact here but it might not be. We should be careful of allowing address digits to differ though - something to add later.

A different example with an inexact match shows that even with a abbreviations and spelling mistakes, taking the best available match still works.

- (BARTHOLOMEW ST**REET** W**EST**, 53 BART**S**OLOMEW ST W, **11**)
- (BARTHOLOMEW STREET WEST, BARTS MEWS, 15)
- (BARTHOLOMEW STREET WEST, EXETER, 19)
- (BARTHOLOMEW STREET WEST, FLAT 11, 20)

In the next post we will look at the problem of combined fields.
