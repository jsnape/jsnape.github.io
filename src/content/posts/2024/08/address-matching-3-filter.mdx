This is a multi-part blog series where I take the single problem of address matching from start to finish.

- [Part 1](https://snape.me/2024/08/address-matching-1-scope): an introduction to the challenge and creation of initial acceptance criteria.
- [Part 2](https://snape.me/2024/08/address-matching-2-postcodes): finding postcodes.
- Part 3 (this one): loading and filtering the AddressBase data set.
- Part 4: Splitting the incoming address into fields.
- Part 5: Working out which field is which with closest match.
- Part 6: Parsing building number from street name.
- Part 7: Matching the full address.
- Part 8: Recap and some ideas for alternate matching methods.

So now we have a postcode, we can fetch a bunch of possible matches. With 33 million records in the full data set I probably wouldn't load the whole thing into memory but instead make a query to a data service such as Cosmos Database or Azure Cache for Redis. For simplicity we will just load the 50,000 records we have.

First we need something to hold the Address Base dataset.

```csharp
public class Address
{
    public required string Uprn { get; set; }

    public required string ClassificationCode { get; set; }

    public required string SingleLineAddress { get; set; }

    public string? Organisation { get; set; }

    public string? SubBuilding { get; set; }

    public string? BuildingName { get; set; }

    public string? BuildingNumber { get; set; }

    public string? StreetName { get; set; }

    public string? Locality { get; set; }

    public string? TownName { get; set; }

    public required string Postcode { get; set; }
}

public interface IPostcodeLookup
{
    IEnumerable<Address> FindByPostcode(string postcode);
}

public class AddressBase(IEnumerable<Address> Addresses) : IPostcodeLookup
{
    private readonly ILookup<string, Address> addresses =
        Addresses.ToLookup(x => x.Postcode.ToUpperInvariant());

    public IEnumerable<Address> FindByPostcode(string postcode)
    {
        return this.addresses[postcode.ToUpperInvariant()];
    }
}
```

Plus some code to load the data from the standard format CSV file. I'm a big fan of [CSVHelper](https://joshclose.github.io/CsvHelper/) for this kind of thing. The mapping needs configuring because the source format field names aren't standard C#.

```csharp
internal class AddressMap : ClassMap<Address>
{
    public AddressMap()
    {
        Map(m => m.Uprn).Name("UPRN");
        Map(m => m.ClassificationCode).Name("CLASSIFICATION_CODE");
        Map(m => m.SingleLineAddress).Name("SINGLE_LINE_ADDRESS");
        Map(m => m.Organisation).Name("ORGANISATION");
        Map(m => m.SubBuilding).Name("SUB_BUILDING");
        Map(m => m.BuildingName).Name("BUILDING_NAME");
        Map(m => m.BuildingNumber).Name("BUILDING_NUMBER");
        Map(m => m.StreetName).Name("STREET_NAME");
        Map(m => m.Locality).Name("LOCALITY");
        Map(m => m.TownName).Name("TOWN_NAME");
        Map(m => m.Postcode).Name("POSTCODE");
    }
}

internal class AddressBaseLoader
{
    public const string AddressBaseFile = "addressbase-core-sample.csv";

    public static IEnumerable<Address> Load(string path)
    {
        using var reader = new StreamReader(path);
        using var csv = new CsvReader(reader, CultureInfo.InvariantCulture);
        csv.Context.RegisterClassMap<AddressMap>();

        // Addresses with an 'R' classification are residential.
        return csv
            .GetRecords<Address>()
            .Where(r => r.ClassificationCode[0] == 'R')
            // Fix - sequence needs materializing before this function returns.
            .ToList();
    }
}
```

Lets check its all working OK and since I want to reuse this data in a lot of unit tests it is worth creating a test fixture.

```csharp
public class AddressBaseFixture
{
    public AddressBaseFixture()
    {
        var addressBaseRecords =
            AddressBaseLoader.Load(AddressBaseLoader.AddressBaseFile);

        AddressBase = new AddressBase(addressBaseRecords);
    }

    public AddressBase AddressBase { get; }
}

[CollectionDefinition(nameof(AddressBaseCollection))]
public class AddressBaseCollection : ICollectionFixture<AddressBaseFixture>
{
}
```

Then the unit tests for valid and missing post codes.

```csharp
[Collection(nameof(AddressBaseCollection))]
public class AddressBaseFacts(AddressBaseFixture Fixture)
{
    private readonly AddressBaseFixture fixture = Fixture;

    [Fact]
    public void FindByMissingPostcodeReturnsEmptyList()
    {
        var candidates = fixture.AddressBase.FindByPostcode("AB12 3CD");
        Assert.Empty(candidates);
    }

    [Theory]
    [ClassData(typeof(BasicAddressExamples))]
    public void FindByPostcodeReturnsMatchingAddresses(
        string _, string postcode, string _1)
    {
        var candidates = fixture.AddressBase.FindByPostcode(postcode);
        Assert.NotEmpty(candidates);
    }
}
```

## Summary

At this point we can find a postcode in the input address and use it to reduce the set of possible options to a handful. In next post we will look at some preprocessing on the input address to make matching easier.
