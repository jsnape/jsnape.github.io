This is a multi-part blog series where I take the single problem of address matching from start to finish.

- [Part 1](../address-matching-1-scope): an introduction to the challenge and creation of initial acceptance criteria.
- [Part 2](../address-matching-2-postcodes): finding postcodes.
- [Part 3](../address-matching-3-filter): loading and filtering the AddressBase data set.
- [Part 4](../address-matching-4-field-splitting): Splitting the incoming address into fields.
- [Part 5](../address-matching-5-closest-match) : Working out which field is which with closest match.
- [Part 6](../address-matching-6-building-number): Parsing building number from street name.
- Part 7 (this one): Matching the full address.
- Part 8: Recap and some ideas for alternate matching methods.
