This is a multi-part blog series where I take the single problem of address matching from start to finish.

- [Part 1](https://snape.me/2024/08/address-matching-1-scope): an introduction to the challenge and creation of initial acceptance criteria.
- [Part 2](https://snape.me/2024/08/address-matching-2-postcodes): finding postcodes.
- [Part 3](https://snape.me/2024/08/address-matching-3-filter): loading and filtering the AddressBase data set.
- Part 4 (this one): Splitting the incoming address into fields.
- Part 5: Working out which field is which with closest match.
- Part 6: Parsing building number from street name.
- Part 7: Matching the full address.
- Part 8: Recap and some ideas for alternate matching methods.

## Introduction

The goal of this post is to process the input address into something a little easier to match against. Again, we will make some assumptions but as few as possible.

UK addresses are written in a number of different ways. On a single line with fields comma separated, on multiple lines with or even a combination of both styles. Some examples from a famous address:

```text
221b Baker Street, London NW1 6XE

Flat B, 221 Baker St., London, NW1 6XE

221B BAKER STREET
LONDON NW1 6XE

221B Baker Street
London
NW1 6XE
```

As a function we need to write, the signature is going to look like `let splitAddress = string -> string seq` (a function that takes a string and returns a string sequence). For C# we need to fill out this function:

```csharp
public IEnumerable<string> SplitAddress(string input)
{

}
```

<Aside type="note" title="Abbreviations">
As this point I should note that I tried to do some abbreviation replacements for example Ave -> Avenue but it got very complex so I decided to drop it. I am hoping the nearest match algorithm in the next post will side step this issue entirely.

Splitting the address on comma or newline boundaries is fairly trivial really.

```csharp
    private static readonly char[] separators = [',', '\r', '\n'];

    public static IEnumerable<string> SplitAddress(string input)
    {
        return input
            .ToUpperInvariant()
            .Split(separators, StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries)
            .Select(c => c.Trim());
    }
```

Plus the test cases:

```csharp
    private readonly List<string> expected =
        ["123 FAKE STREET", "LONDON", "W1A 1AA"];

    [Fact]
    public void SplitAddressSingleLineAddressReturnsCorrectParts()
    {
        string input = "123 Fake Street, London, W1A 1AA";
        var result = Splitter.SplitAddress(input).ToList();

        Assert.Equal(expected, result);
    }

    [Fact]
    public void SplitAddressMultiLineAddressReturnsCorrectParts()
    {
        string input = "123 Fake Street\r\nLondon\r\nW1A 1AA";
        var result = Splitter.SplitAddress(input).ToList();

        Assert.Equal(expected, result);
    }

    [Fact]
    public void SplitAddressEmptyEntriesReturnsCorrectParts()
    {
        string input = "123 Fake Street,,London,\r\nW1A 1AA";
        var result = Splitter.SplitAddress(input).ToList();

        Assert.Equal(expected, result);
    }

    [Fact]
    public void SplitAddressEmptyStringReturnsEmptyList()
    {
        string input = string.Empty;
        var result = Splitter.SplitAddress(input).ToList();

        Assert.Empty(result);
    }
```

With an address split into lines we can start to try and match it with one of the records that the postcode filtered to.
