description: >-
  There are generally no field separators between building number and street so how can they be split?

This is a multi-part blog series where I take the single problem of address matching from start to finish.

- [Part 1](https://snape.me/2024/08/address-matching-1-scope): an introduction to the challenge and creation of initial acceptance criteria.
- [Part 2](https://snape.me/2024/08/address-matching-2-postcodes): finding postcodes.
- [Part 3](https://snape.me/2024/08/address-matching-3-filter): loading and filtering the AddressBase data set.
- [Part 4](https://snape.me/2024/08/address-matching-4-field-splitting): Splitting the incoming address into fields.
- [Part 5](https://snape.me/2024/08/address-matching-5-closest-match) : Working out which field is which with closest match.
- Part 6 (this one): Parsing building number from street name.
- Part 7: Matching the full address.
- Part 8: Recap and some ideas for alternate matching methods.

Often we see composite fields such as the building number joined to the street field without a comma or newline separator. If the candidate matched is shorter we should split the field and re-add the left part back into the unmatched set. Using the following example:

> FLAT 11, BARTS MEWS, 53 BARTHOLOMEW STREET WEST, EX4 3AJ

After the street match, the available set of candidates should really be `FLAT 11, BARTS MEWS, 53` but currently the last element would be missing because the closest match would ignore the `53` part of the string. What needs to happen is: detect the match was imperfect, extract the leading part of the matched field and re-add it back the the unmatched parts for future matches.

I will discuss more about `MatchState` in the next post but suffice to say its holding the list of unmatched parts and we want to put a part back if it is split from the previous match.

How should the split operate? Originally I tried taking the extra letters at the start of the field above the length of the matched candidate but that didn't work when the match isn't exact. A better option turns out to be look for the 1st `SPACE` character and then take up to that index. This works because building numbers don't have spaces in and towns still match the first word well enough in multi-word towns.

To split a matched field in the case of combined town/postcode and building number/street combinations:

```csharp
    internal static MatchState SplitMatchedField(MatchState state)
    {
        if (state.LastMatchedCandidate == null || state.LastMatchedPart == null)
        {
            // Nothing matched.
            return state;
        }

        // Fix: Converting to spans saves a few allocations when slicing below.
        var candidate = state.LastMatchedCandidate.AsSpan();
        var matched = state.LastMatchedPart.AsSpan();

        var firstSpaceIndex = matched.IndexOf(' ');

        if (firstSpaceIndex > 0)
        {
            var leftMatched = matched[..firstSpaceIndex];
            var leftCandidate = candidate[..firstSpaceIndex];

            if (!leftMatched.SequenceEqual(leftCandidate))
            {
                state = state with
                {
                    UnmatchedParts = state.UnmatchedParts.Add(leftMatched.ToString())
                };
            }
        }

        return state;
    }
```

A short post this time because the next one is going to be very long. By the end of it we should have a pretty decent matching algorithm.
