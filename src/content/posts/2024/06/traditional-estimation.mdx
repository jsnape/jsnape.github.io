  Since I do a lot of pre-sales the agile relative estimation techniques don't work so I have to resort to traditional estimation methods. This is how I make sure new projects are estimated accurately.

  alt: "A serene and tranquil scene of the ocean meeting the sky at the horizon. It is characterized by its simplicity, with clear blue waters below and a lighter blue sky above. The lower part of the image is dominated by the ocean, characterized by its rich turquoise color. The waters appear calm with subtle waves, reflecting light to give it a sparkling effect. Above the ocean lies an expansive sky, transitioning from a deeper blue at the top to a lighter shade as it meets the horizon. It’s clear and free of clouds, contributing to the overall peacefulness of the scene. The central focus is where the ocean meets the sky – forming a distinct yet soft horizon line that separates yet unites these two dominant elements."
