Just a quick reminder that there is no point manually checking database constraints before modifying your data. Take this code:

```sql
create table Users (
    UserID uniqueidentifier primary key not null default newid(),
    LoginName nvarchar(50) not null unique
)

if not exists (
    select * from Users where LoginName = 'JohnSmith'
)
begin
    insert into Users (LoginName) values ('JohnSmith')
end
```

There is a race condition between the _if not exists_ check and the insertion of data. Another connection could insert the same data before this insert gets a chance to complete. We could wrap the check and insert in a transaction to make sure consistency as follows (note the isolation level because we need to place a range lock on data that could be there):

```sql
begin tran
    set transaction isolation level repeatable read
    if not exists ( select * from Users where LoginName = 'JohnSmith' )
    begin
        insert into Users (LoginName) values ('JohnSmith')
    end
commit
```

This works but we've got the added cost of a transaction. There is no point in doing this though as there is already a unique constraint on the column and databases are very good at checking constraints. With this in mind, the new and improved version looks like:

```sql
insert into Users (LoginName) values ('JohnSmith')
```

Much simpler. There is only one minor problem, for which I don’t have an answer, and that is if you have multiple constraints on a table then it’s very difficult to find which one failed. The _@@error_ variable will be set to 547 (constraint violation) and a suitable _raiserror_ is generated which could be parsed by the caller but not easily.
